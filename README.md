# autonomous_mobile_robot
The Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) is a capstone project for a robotics specialization program through the University of Pennsylvania.

##Note
I did not write some of the simulation code for Python. That came from the good people at Penn. I take no credit for it. Imlimentation of path planning/perception algorithms and other controls were written by myself for this project.
