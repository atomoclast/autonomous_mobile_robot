    Implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
    Input:
    occupancy_map - an N by M numpy array of boolean values (represented
        as integers 0 and 1) that represents the locations of the obstacles
        in the world
    x_spacing - parameter representing spacing between adjacent columns
    y_spacing - parameter representing spacing between adjacent rows
    start - a 3 by 1 numpy array of (x,y,theta) for the starting position 
    goal - a 3 by 1 numpy array of (x,y,theta) for the finishing position 
    Output:
